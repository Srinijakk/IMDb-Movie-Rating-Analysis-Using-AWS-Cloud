# üé¨ IMDb Movie Rating Analysis Using AWS Cloud

## üìå Project Overview
This project utilizes AWS Cloud services to analyze and extract insights from IMDb movie datasets. It demonstrates how to design and deploy an **automated, scalable ETL pipeline** capable of handling large datasets for real-time analytics. The goal is to uncover trends related to **movie ratings, genres, directors, stars, and box office performance**, enabling users to explore movie metrics via interactive dashboards.

## üìä Dataset Description
The IMDb dataset includes the following fields:

- `Poster_Link`, `Series_Title`, `Released_Year`, `Certificate`, `Runtime`, `Genre`
- `IMDB_Rating`, `Overview`, `Meta_score`, `Director`
- `Star1`, `Star2`, `Star3`, `Star4`
- `No_of_Votes`, `Gross`

---

## üöÄ Project Workflow

### 1. Data Ingestion
- Upload IMDb dataset (CSV) to Amazon S3.

### 2. Schema Detection & Cataloging
- Use AWS Glue Crawler to detect schema and register it in the AWS Glue Data Catalog.

### 3. ETL Processing (AWS Glue)
- Handle missing values in `Gross`, `Meta_score`, and `IMDB_Rating`.
- Normalize and convert data types (e.g., `Runtime` to numeric).
- Load the cleaned and transformed data into Amazon Redshift.

### 4. Data Analysis
Using Redshift and Athena for querying:
- Top-rated movies by genre
- Impact of directors/stars on ratings and revenue
- Yearly box office income trends
- Correlation between rating, votes, and metascore

### 5. Data Visualization (Amazon QuickSight)
Create dashboards showing:
- Genre-wise IMDb rating distribution
- Top 10 movies by box office gross
- Director/star performance trends
- Correlation between votes and ratings

### 6. Automation & Monitoring
- Automate Glue job triggers using AWS Lambda when new data is uploaded to S3.
- Use CloudWatch for real-time monitoring of ETL job execution and error logs.
